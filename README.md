MLB Salary Analysis

In this statistical analysis, I was interested whether or not there was a correlation between an MLB team's average player salary and the number of games they won.
Using the Lahmans dataset in R, I compiled all my necessary data and plotted it with a linear regression line. Keep in mind that the salary number might sound lower than what is typical in today's game due to the time frame of my dataset (1985-2016)
Based on the graph, there is a positive correlation between a teams number of wins and the average player salary. Although this is the case in this analysis, it is not always true that the best teams have the highest payroll.
